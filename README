This is custom, with the following changes:
- delete works
- ctrl+shift+plus/minus to inc/dec font size
- the following scrollback patches from https://st.suckless.org/patches/scrollback/

- transparency from this commit by Tharre: https://github.com/Tharre/st-transparency/commit/da5e2454c0e7ec252c92414b911cb5535052e60c.diff

I consider these to be sane defaults, with a bit of eye candy.

Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.

For Nix (and NixOS) users, the provided nix flake handles dependencies for you.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

For Nix (and NixOS) users, a nix flake is provided:

    nix --experimental-features "flakes nix-command" build


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
