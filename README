st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

This is custom, with the following changes:
- delete works
- ctrl+shift+plus/minus to inc/dec font size
- the following [scrollback patches](https://st.suckless.org/patches/scrollback/)
- transparency from [this commit by Tharre](https://github.com/Tharre/st-transparency/commit/da5e2454c0e7ec252c92414b911cb5535052e60c)

I consider these to be sane defaults, with a bit of eye candy.

Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
